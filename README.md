The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows:

1) Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)

2) Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process

3) Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis

4) Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)

5) Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
 
6) Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions

7) Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, 
    and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
